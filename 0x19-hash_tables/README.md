# 0x19. C - Hash tables

**What you should learn from this project**

    At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a hash function
* What makes a good hash function
* What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
* What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
* What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Exercises

[0-hash_table_create.c](./0-hash_table_create.c)
```
Write a function that creates a hash table.
```
* Prototype: hash_table_t *hash_table_create(unsigned long int size);
  * where size is the size of the array
* Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table
* If something went wrong, your function should return NULL

[1-djb2.c](./1-djb2.c)
```
Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
```
* Prototype: unsigned long int hash_djb2(const unsigned char *str);
* You are allowed to copy and paste the function from this page

[2-key_index.c](./2-key_index.c)
```
Write a function that gives you the index of a key.
```
* Prototype: unsigned long int key_index(const unsigned char *key, unsigned long int size);
  * where key is the key
  * and size is the size of the array of the hash table
* This function should use the hash_djb2 function that you wrote earlier
* Returns the index at which the key/value pair should be stored in the array of the hash table
* You will have to use this hash function for all the next tasks

[3-hash_table_set.c](./3-hash_table_set.c)
```
Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.
```
* Prototype: int hash_table_set(hash_table_t *ht, const char *key, const char *value); 
  * Where ht is the hash table you want to add or update the key/value to
  * key is the key. key can not be an empty string
  * and value is the value associated with the key. value must be duplicated. value can be an empty string
* Returns: 1 if it succeeded, 0 otherwise
* In case of collision, add the new node at the beginning of the list

[4-hash_table_get.c](./4-hash_table_get.c)
```
Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
```
* Prototype: char *hash_table_get(const hash_table_t *ht, const char *key);
  * where ht is the hash table you want to look into
  * and key is the key you are looking for
* Returns the value associated with the element, or NULL if key couldn’t be found

[5-hash_table_print.c](./5-hash_table_print.c)
```
Write a function that prints a hash table.
```
* Prototype: void hash_table_print(const hash_table_t *ht);
  * where ht is the hash table
* You should print the key/value in the order that they appear in the array of hash table 
  * Order: array, list
* Format: see example
* If ht is NULL, don’t print anything

[6-hash_table_delete.c](./6-hash_table_delete.c)
```
Write a function that deletes a hash table.
```
* Prototype: void hash_table_delete(hash_table_t *ht);
  * where ht is the hash table
